# Custom Sticker System

## Summary

Similar to LINE or Kakao Talk's sticker store, this feature will allow posting of custom
"stickers" on the chat. You can purchase them through a store similar to LINE's
sticker store. Artists can upload and sell their own stickers.

## Motivation

Using LINE stickers is really fun, and adding this feature might make using the
chat more fun too.

It's a cool way for DJs, artists, and myself to make a small amount of money.

## Detailed design

Datafruits (tony) will take a perecentage of all sales.

This will require implementing a login system to the chat, so we can store which
stickers the user has purchased.

## Drawbacks

There haven't really been any other attempts to monetize datafruits directly
(excluding merch and bandcamp sales) other than the Patreon. I'm not sure how
fans will feel about this.
