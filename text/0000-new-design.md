# New design

## Summary

Overhaul and redesign of the UI to better suit mobile and other devices.

## Motivation

While datafruits *works* on mobile right now, its not a great experience.

* Play button is too small.
* Menu has been broken or difficult to use for awhile now.

It would be nice to display more info about the current program and not focus so
much on chat as the primary experience.

## Detailed design

Use a menu at the bottom with 4 links only, and a 'more' menu for viewing the
rest of the menu.

The 4 links will be:
Chat Timetable Podcasts Blog

The rest of the menu:
Shop
About
DJ on datafruits
(links to SNS accounts)

On top of that menu is the 'play bar' you see now. We will display more info
about the current show than before, like the time, linking to the show's detail
page etc.

## Drawbacks

Honestly I can't think of any right now. Lots of people have been asking for
better mobile support.

## Alternatives

TBD

## Unresolved questions
