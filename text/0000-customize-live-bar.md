# Customize live bar

## Summary

Allow DJs to set a custom background .gif for the live bar.

## Motivation

Right now you only get the pink sparkley background, DJs should be able to
express themselves with any colour of sparkleys or rotating pizzas, etc.

## Detailed design

A small dropdown menu for picking a gif, underneath the one for customizing the
stream title on Streampusher. The default will be the pink sparkley one, if one
is not selected.

## Drawbacks

Promotes the 'net trash' aesthetic of the site even further.

## Alternatives

TBD

## Unresolved questions

Should users be able to upload their own gifs, or should there be a
predetermined set?
