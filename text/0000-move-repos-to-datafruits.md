## Summary

I'd like to move all the repos under the streampusher org to datafruits.

## Motivation

It's too confusing to have so many repos under two different orgs.

## Detailed design

Just move the repos

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this?

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
